## Purpose

"Whiteboarding" is a collection of common to uncommon possible whiteboarding questions you may be asked in an interview. This repo is meant to serve as a personal reference guide and is updated daily with new problems. **The goal is to focus on the overall concept of each problem rather than just memorizing specific syntax. Understanding the WHY of each problem will translate into real world use cases.**
